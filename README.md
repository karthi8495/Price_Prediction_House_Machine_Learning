# Price_Prediction_House_Machine_Learning

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on a variety of features such as the number of rooms, location, area, and other relevant factors. We employ advanced machine learning techniques for this purpose, including feature selection, model optimization, and deployment via a Streamlit application.

Features
  Data Exploration: Comprehensive analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
  Feature Selection: Identifying the most significant features impacting house prices.
  Model Training and Optimization: Utilizing cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search/Random Search) to optimize the model.
  Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
  Deployment: Deploying the model using a Streamlit application, which allows users to input data and receive predictions. The application also includes a report download functionality.
  ZIP File: The repository includes a ZIP file containing all relevant datasets, pre-trained models (.pkl files), and other resources needed to replicate or extend the project.
